🛠️ I'm a software developer, primarily focused on microcontrollers. Additionally, I have experience in building and repairing electronic devices.

✍🏻 I write about topics related to electronics, programming, and technologies from both yesterday and today.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning Machine Learning.

💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on open-source projects, both in physical prototyping and software development.

👀 I have a wide range of interests, including education, electronics, microcontrollers, Machine Learning, data science, Arduino, Internet of Things, home automation, programming (especially in languages like C/C++, MicroPython, and Python), 3D printing, GNU/Linux, open hardware, free software, and retrocomputing.
